## Introduction

FreeRTOS is a popular real-time operating system kernel widely used in embedded systems. It enables developers to manage multiple tasks concurrently, ensuring predictable behavior and real-time responsiveness. This repository aims to provide practical examples for implementing FreeRTOS on the STM32F334 microcontroller platform.

## Getting Started

To start using the code examples in this repository, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prasanna-kumar18/FreeRTOS_STM32F334.git
```

## Hardware Setup
Connect your STM32F334 development board to your computer via the appropriate interface (e.g., USB, UART, etc.).

## Toolchain Setup
Ensure that you have the necessary toolchain installed for STM32 development, such as the STM32CubeIDE or a compatible toolchain.

## Build and Flash
Navigate to the desired example project folder and use your toolchain to build the project. Flash the compiled binary onto your STM32F334 development board.

## Examples
Explore a variety of examples demonstrating different aspects of FreeRTOS on the STM32F334 platform. Each example is contained in its own folder and includes a README file with details about its functionality. Some of the included examples are:

[4_Software_Timer](https://github.com/Prasanna-kumar18/FreeRTOS_STM32F334/tree/main/4.0_Software_Timer) : Introduces the concept of software timers in FreeRTOS.

[5_Queue](https://github.com/Prasanna-kumar18/FreeRTOS_STM32F334/tree/main/5.0_Queue_Basic-int-data-sharing) : Shows how to use message queues or other communication mechanisms between tasks.

[6.1.1_Binary Semaphore](https://github.com/Prasanna-kumar18/FreeRTOS_STM32F334/tree/main/6.1.1_Binary_Semaphore_same_priority) : Demonstrates safe resource sharing between tasks using Semaphore.

[6.2_Counting Semaphore](https://github.com/Prasanna-kumar18/FreeRTOS_STM32F334/tree/main/6.2_Counting_Semaphore) : Demonstrates safe resource sharing between tasks using Semaphore.

[6.3_Mutex](https://github.com/Prasanna-kumar18/FreeRTOS_STM32F334/tree/main/6.3_Mutex) : Shows how to safely use shared resources using Mutual Exclusion.

[6.4_Priority_inversion_Solution-with Mutex](https://github.com/Prasanna-kumar18/FreeRTOS_STM32F334/tree/main/6.4_Priority_inversion_Solution-with-Mutex) : prevent priority inversion by temporarily raising the priority of a lower-priority task holding a mutex needed by a higher-priority task.

[6.5 Deadlock With Mutex](https://github.com/Prasanna-kumar18/FreeRTOS_STM32F334/tree/main/6.5_Deadlock-with-Mutex) : Demonstrates the deadlock between tasks while using the same shared resources using mutex.
